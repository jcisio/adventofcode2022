# Advent Of Code 2022
Participation in the programming puzzles [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

The test input is in `dNN.in`, download the real input to `dNN.test`. Change the path at the end of `dNN.py`.

To run, simply: `python dayNN/dNN.py`. Some later days support printing debug message, to remove the message: `python -O dayNN/dNN.py`

Not tested, but most code is compatible with pypy3, at least for the last days.
